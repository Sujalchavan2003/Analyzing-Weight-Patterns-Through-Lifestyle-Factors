# Analyzing-Weight-Patterns-Through-Lifestyle-Factors
A Python-based EDA project exploring the impact of lifestyle habits like diet, alcohol consumption, transportation, and family history on weight and obesity levels.


## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Analysis Performed
- Gender distribution vs weight
- Family history of overweight vs weight
- High-calorie food consumption vs weight
- Alcohol consumption vs weight
- Transportation mode vs weight
- Obesity level distribution


## Key Insights
- Individuals with a family history of overweight tend to have higher average weight
- Frequent consumption of high-calorie food is associated with increased obesity risk
- Active transportation modes (walking, biking) are linked to lower body weight
- Obesity patterns are influenced by multiple interacting lifestyle factors

## Conclusion
Body weight and obesity are not driven by a single habit but by a combination of
dietary choices, physical activity, alcohol consumption, and family history.
Balanced lifestyle behaviors play a crucial role in managing healthy weight.
